#Tables

Markdown cannot handle complex tables.  Below is a simple table for presentation


Good Food | Bad Food
------|------
fruits | candy
carrots | potato chips
oily fish | fatty meat

---

First Name | Last Name | Points
--- | --- | ---
Jack | Johnson | 350
Sue | Johnson | 540
Bill | Tolbert | 640
Jill | Tolbert | 780

Note: Markdown does not allow for much control over spacing in your columns
